This repo contains the code of the LetMeSleep Android alarm application.

This application is an alarm that forces you to shake your phone to allow you to turn off or snooze the alarm.
This application is no longer available in the android app store but the code is available for anyone to use it. Maybe one day I'll update it to current standards.


Some screenshots of the application:
